# Frontend Application

This is the frontend application for a multi-step form and user authentication dashboard built with React.

## Features

- **Home Page**: A welcoming homepage with a "Login" button that navigates to the login page.
- **Registration Form**: A form that gathers user information across multiple steps (name, email, password, address, etc.).
- **User Authentication**: Protects routes like the dashboard using JWT-based authentication.
- **Dashboard**: Displays user details and includes an "Edit Profile" option to update information.
- **State Management**: Uses React Context or Redux for managing form and user authentication state.
